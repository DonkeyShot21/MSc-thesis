\noindent The strong influence of the Sun on the environment of the Earth makes it necessary to monitor and predict its activity. Sunspots, manifestations of strong pertubations in the magnetic field of the Sun, are one of the visible features that can be studied in order to model solar activity cycles. So far, sunspot counting has been mostly done by humans and the scientific comunity seems reluctant to the introduction of algorithms because they would create a discontinuity with traditional observations. The purpose of this thesis, which lays at the intersection of observational solar physics and cutting-edge computer science, is to demonstrate that, using deep learning, it is possible to build a program capable of learning from expert scientists and performing solar image annotation automatically, according to human criteria. Test cases were designed to assess the quality of our solution with respect to average human performance. The results are promising and show that the algorithm can capture the progress of the solar cycle, making it a good tool for the estimation of the activity of the Sun.
