\thispagestyle{empty}
- look at other clustering methods that solve the density problem
- use more data, incorporate past cycles
- use triplet loss instead of contrastive or hybrid siamese network
- use heterogeneous annotations
- try to train instance segmentation inside the network
- use NOAA sunspot dataset too
- use STARA and try to replicate the same experiments
- a more accurate study on the minimization of the dependencies inside the dataset
- end to end training
- integrate penumbra
- look into why eps does not gingilla
